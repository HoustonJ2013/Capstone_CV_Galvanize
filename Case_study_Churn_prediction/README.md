The raw data sets were split into training/test parts by 80/20. The test data set was not used until the end of this study to verify the prediction power of the model. 


Work flows[Jupter Notebook](Case_Study.ipynb): 
1. Data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and visualizations. 

2. Train a random forest model to predict the user churn rate. 

3. Feature importance analysis

4. Business value (benifit/cost Matrix) and Optimize model

5. Make recommendations
