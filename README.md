# Capstone Project: Pixel-level Object Dectection 
## Semantic Segmentation: State of art


Semantic segmentation is the frontier of computer image recognition, which understand an image at pixel level. In segmantic segmentation, we will need to achieve three tasks: 1. recognize the objects; 2. delineate the boundary of each object; 3. Assign each pixel in the image an object class.
